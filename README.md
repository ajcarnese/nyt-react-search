props, state and the component life cycle

If Components are functions in React, Props are the arguments used to set the functions.  Props are essentially the input aspects of Components.  Using the props set in the React Component code, you can control what data is displayed on screen.  When React sees a user-defined component, it passes attributes to the component as an object, which is considered a "prop."

"State" is similar to props, but it is controlled by the components, rather than user-interaction.  State is only available to use by components that are defined as classes.

A component's "lifecycle" or lifecycle-hook is specific code that runs whenever the component changes its  components mount and unmount.
